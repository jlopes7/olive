# Olive Oil Intelligent Load Distribution (aka OOILD)
Olive is a modern open source Load Balancer written in Java to solve key HA patterns and standards. It uses server introspection and intelligent load distribution to determine (compute) the right load path for your backend applications.

**OOID** is based on Apache's _Http Components_ to serve its HTTP asymptomatic requests, and several APIs (_including a dedicated JVM agent_) to maintain its functions.
